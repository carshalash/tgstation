changes: 
  - rscadd: "Large scale heretic revamp!"
  - expansion: "The Codex Cicatrix is no longer a roundstart heretic item. Research is handled through their antag info UI. Rune drawing is done by using a writing tool with Mansus Grasp active in your offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable ritual item now."
  - expansion: "The Living Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual heart now becomes their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing your heart (being disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it."
  - expansion: "The Hereic Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their mechanics as well as providing some helpful tips for newer players."
  - expansion: "Most heretic spells now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make a basic focus necklace, and some heretic equipment also functions as a focus. (Credit to Imaginos for the focus sprite!)"
  - expansion: "Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20 minutes."
  - expansion: "Heretic sacrificing  has been reworked. You can now sacrifice people who are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs them, and teleports them to the SHADOW REALM, where they must dodge a barrage of hands to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die, and your body will be thrown back."
  - expansion: "Heretics now have a few new rituals, including the Ritual of Knowledge, a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge points."
  - expansion: "Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete your objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all the final rituals have been changed a bit!"
  - qol: "Using the Heretic's Mansus Grasp on surfaces (EX: Rust Grasp) now works on right-click, instead of combat mode."
  - qol: "Used heretic influences can now be removed with a Anomaly Neutralizers."
  - balance: "Some heretic rituals are now limited in the amount they can make. You can only have up to 2 heretic blades crafted at once (3 if you are Path of Flesh)."
  - balance: "The Lord of the Night has been buffed to be a little scarier. Did you know the Lord of the Night can eat arms to regain body parts and heal?"
  - balance: "Buffed some heretic summons - mostly their health pools."
  - balance: "Nerfed the heretic's Mask of Madness. It can no longer infinite stam-crit you."
  - balance: "Nerfed the heretic's ash mark."
  - balance: "Nerfed a bunch of on-hit-heretic-blade effects. Many effects only apply on mark detonation now: Void blade silence, flesh blade wounds, ash blade gasp cooldown refund."
  - bugfix: "Fixed quite a few bugs and unintended behaviors with heretic code."
  - refactor: "Refactored and improved much of Heretic code. Improved the file structure dramatically."
  - admin: "The heretic's traitor panel has been beefed up a bit."
